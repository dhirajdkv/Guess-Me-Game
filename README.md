# Guess-Me-Game-

This is a simple guessing game if your lucky enough. 

First when you open the GuessIt.html page you'll be having 4x6 matrix of rows and columns.

How to play:
1. Open the GuessIt.html page.
2. Click on the first circle of first row and enter some number within 10 and **click enter**.
3. Likewise, complete the first row first and then you'll be going to second row(I haven't coded for displaying rows dynamically).
4. While you enter each number and click enter you'll get that circle filled either with red, green or yellow.
5. Now how this circle is getting that colors... I would've set some random numbers for each of the circles row by row.
6. If you enter the correct number in correct circle then you'll get the circle colored green, If you enter the number that is somewhere in the row but not at that position then you'll get orange background, If the number you've entered is'nt in the numbers that i've generated then you'll get red color.
7. By looking at the game you can tell that you got four chances to finish the game. Complete the first row first and then come to second row, followed by other rows.
8. If you enter the numbers in correct positions i.e correct circles then you'll win.

Yes, this game can be made more interactive and cool. But this was my first ever game created using JS HTML and CSS.
